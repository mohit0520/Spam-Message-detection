# Deploying SPAM Classifier to Web using Streamlit
This program deploys a trained SPAM classification Machine Learning model onto a web interface using Streamlit.
The program accepts user input, preprocesses it, vectorizes it using a pre-trained TfidfVectorizer, and makes predictions using a pre-trained Extra Trees model for classifying spam messages.
